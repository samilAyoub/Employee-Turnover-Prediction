In order for an organization to continually have a higher competitive advantage over its competition, it should make it a duty to minimize employee attrition. 
There is a lot of steps for an organization to minimize employee attrition. However, the most recent and effective solution to deal with such a problem is using machine learning algorithms to predict employees who are most likely to exit.
